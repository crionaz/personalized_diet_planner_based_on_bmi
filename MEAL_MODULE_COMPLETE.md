- Filter by category, difficulty, cuisine
- Filter by prep time, cook time
- Filter by calorie range
- Diet compatibility filtering (vegan, keto, etc.)
- Pagination support

#### Nutrition Tracking

- Complete nutritional information per meal
- Per-serving nutrition calculation
- Ingredient-level nutrition data
- Calorie and macronutrient tracking

#### User Experience

## Integration Points

The MEAL module integrates with:

- **USER module** - Creator tracking, dietary preferences
- **AUTH module** - Authentication and authorization
- **Shared types** - Cross-module type consistency

## Ready for Next Modules

With AUTH, USER, BMI, and MEAL modules complete, we can now build:

1. **DIET PLAN Module** - AI-powered meal planning using our meal database
2. **TRACK Module** - Food logging and progress tracking

The foundation is solid and ready for the complete diet planner application!

## Example Usage

### Creating a Meal

```typescript
const mealData = {
  name: "Grilled Chicken Salad",
  category: MealCategory.LUNCH,
  prepTime: 15,
  cookTime: 20,
  servings: 2,
  difficulty: "easy",
  ingredients: [
    {
      name: "Chicken breast",
      amount: 200,
      unit: "g",
      calories: 330,
      protein: 62,
      carbs: 0,
      fat: 7
    }
  ],
  instructions: ["Season chicken", "Grill for 8 minutes each side"],
  isPublic: true
};

const meal = await createMeal(mealData);
```

### Searching Meals

```typescript
const meals = await getMeals({
  category: MealCategory.DINNER,
  difficulty: "easy",
  caloriesMax: 500,
  dietType: "keto"
});
```

This completes our MEAL module implementation! ðŸŽ‰
